# Pizza Sales Data Analysis and Visualization
### Project Overview: Pizza Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to extract insights and trends using data analysis and visualization techniques. The main purpose of this analysis is to understand the total number of pizzas sold, identify sales trends by month and weekday, and calculate average orders per day. The analysis was conducted using Power BI and MS SQL Server.

### Project Steps:

1. **Problem Statement:**
   - Our mission was to unravel the mysteries behind our pizza sales data and extract valuable insights into our business performance. We crunched the numbers using SQL to calculate key metrics such as:
     1. Total Revenue Over The Year
     2. Average Order Value
     3. Total Pizzas Sold
     4. Total Orders
     5. Average Pizzas Per Order

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Perform data exploration using MS SQL Server to understand the structure and content of the dataset.

3. **Data Cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
   - Clean the raw data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - Transform and load the data to make it suitable for analysis.

4. **Analyze Business Problems:**
   - Analyze the data to identify trends, most profitable categories, preferred pizza sizes, and total quantity sold over the year.

5. **Utilizing DAX Functions:**
   - Use DAX functions in Power Query Editor for advanced data analysis:
     - `SUM()`
     - `DIVIDE`
     - `MONTH()`
     - `DAYNAME()`
     - `ALL()`

6. **Building the Dashboard:**
   - Develop a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI to present the analysis findings effectively.

### Key Insights and Stages:

1. **Data Exploration Using MS SQL Server:**
   - Load the data into MS SQL Server and explore its structure using SQL queries.

2. **Data Cleaning and ETL:**
   - Clean the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Transform the data by adding calculated columns as needed.
   - Load the cleaned data into Power BI for further analysis.

3. **Business Analysis:**
   - Identify key business metrics and perform analysis to extract insights.

4. **Using DAX Functions:**
   - Calculate necessary metrics using DAX functions to enhance data analysis.

5. **Dashboard Development in Power BI:**
   - Create an interactive dashboard with the following charts and visualizations:
     - **Daily Trend for Total Orders**
     - **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**
     - **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**
     - **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size**
     - **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category**
     - **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Quantity, and Orders**
     - **Bottom 5 Sellers by Revenue, Quantity, and Orders**

### Interactive Charts and Visualizations:

- **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** Analyze the daily sales trend to identify peak days.
- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** Track the monthly sales trend to spot seasonal patterns.
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** Determine the contribution of each pizza category to total sales.
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:** Understand the distribution of sales across different pizza sizes.
- **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:** Identify the most popular pizza categories.
- **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Quantity, and Orders:** Highlight the top-performing pizzas.
- **Bottom 5 Sellers by Revenue, Quantity, and Orders:** Identify the least popular pizzas.

### Tools Used:

- **Power BI:** For data analysis and visualization.
- **MS SQL Server (SSMS):** For data exploration and querying.
